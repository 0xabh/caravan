## üìñ Introduction

- Welcome to the Caravan - Cross chain ERC 4337 compatible browser extensions Extension repository. This extension aims to deliver a seamless user experience for managing, transferring, and interacting with assets across multiple blockchain networks, all from a single interface. By abstracting away the complexities inherent in cross-chain operations.

---

## ‚ôØ Description

- **Multi-Network Compatibility:** Caravan's browser-based wallet is engineered for compatibility with more than **7** blockchain networks. This functionality aims to simplify cross-chain transactions and reduce the complexity of managing multiple wallets, each tied to a specific network.

- **Smart Payment System:** Caravan's architecture accommodates transactions both with and without the involvement of paymasters. This flexibility allows users to opt for traditional transaction fee structures or to leverage subsidized fees, depending on their requirements.

- **Asset Management and Security:** Two key features distinguish Caravan's approach to asset management. First, a social recovery mechanism using OTP ensures that wallet access is recoverable across multiple devices. Second, an automated staking feature for DAI (sDAI) allows users to earn yield on idle assets, with the option for convenient conversion back to DAI.

Caravan leverages several cutting-edge technologies to offer a secure and seamless experience

### Tableland:
- Implemented Tableland to store all same-chain and cross-chain transactions. [Code Link](https://github.com/0xabh/caravan/blob/main/tableland/index.js)
- Studio team name:- Suhel / Caravan. 
- Dev Address:- 0xb7Bd02B95B13F3F0536BdCCb425D7086564B5fBA. [Tableland Table link](https://tablescan.io/tx_data_80001_7889)
### UMA's Across:
- To fecilitate fast and cheap cross-chain transfers across all 7 networks, we used accross's across bridge which is built on top of UMA's optimisic oracle.
- [Code Link](https://github.com/0xabh/caravan/blob/dfdc06bd046124e85e1aa2beeeb772e7f8cd89f7/extension/src/pages/App/pages/transfer-asset/transfer-asset.tsx#L4)
### Spark:

- We implemented Auto Deposit such that when the user is not using his funds, the idle liquidity can be used to earn yeild, which is why we used Spark's sDAI to fulfill this goal.

> **Warning**
> Auto refresh is disabled by default, so you will have to manually refresh the page.
> If you make changes in background script or account-api, you will also have to refresh the background page. Check instructions on how to do that below.

> **Warning**
> Logs of all the blockchain interactions are shown in the background script. Do keep it open for faster debugging.

### How to see and refresh background page

1. Open extension's page: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find the Trampoline extension, and click Details.
3. Check the `Inspect views` area and click on `background page` to inspect it's logs
4. To refresh click `cmd + r` or `ctrl + r` in the background inspect page to refresh the background script.
